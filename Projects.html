         <h3>February 24</h3>
<p>
  <em>Find me in this silence, so exhausting and deep,<br />
  Help me know myself in the moonlight I keep.<br />
  I’m lost in despair, my thoughts a wild chase,<br />
  Which I can’t escape, they won’t leave a trace.</em><br /><br />

  <em>Agony surrounds me, a firm, tight embrace,<br />
  Bound by time’s grip, I can't find my place.<br />
  Help me bear this burden, heavy and vast,<br />
  For in your hands, my breath is confined fast.</em><br /><br />

  <em>The night sky is painted in hues of deep red,<br />
  I’m alone among many, and fear fills my head.<br />
  I run and I rush, while cobwebs ensnare,<br />
  My soul’s just as mortal as hope in the air.</em><br /><br />

  <em>My goal is to win, yet that’s not enough,<br />
  I long to break free, to be bold and tough.<br />
  When that day comes, and I’m not by your side,<br />
  Please remember my hope, as it floats with the tide.</em>

		  <h3> Childhood </h3>
           <p>
      <em>To extinguish the flames that burn in the distance is tough,<br />
      Confessing to you all the burdens I've had is quite rough.<br />
      Forgiving the one who loves me feels far too painful,<br />
      I long to escape from this home that's so shameful.</em><br /><br />

      <em>Winding scars tell the tale of my childhood days,<br />
      Empty courtyards reflect what motherhood conveys.<br />
      Dazed by the moss, they embark on their quest,<br />
      While I stand, hungry, beneath this roof's crest.</em><br /><br />

      <em>Rain fills the earth with a void it can't bear,<br />
      Melted snow brightens the joys of youth's air.<br />
      Children, so happy, will run through the dew,<br />
      Full yards will remind me of dreams untrue.</em><br /><br />

      <em>I stand on bricks that are not yet in place,<br />
      Always waiting for you, like the morning’s embrace.<br />
      I rush by the stream, seeking solace and grace,<br />
      I pause, knowing they’ll never return to this space.</em>

		  <h3> The mask </h3>
          <p> 
<em>Faceless wanderers drift through the night,<br />
Living in shadows, hidden from sight.<br />
Caught in the webs of their pointless despair,<br />
Alone in the battle of feelings laid bare.<br /><br />

Souls that are sinking in sorrowful plight,<br />
Remind me of rainbows that fade from the light.<br />
A landscape of bleakness, in black and in white,<br />
They strive to release you from this endless fight.<br /><br />

Bind me up tightly, let shadows not flee,<br />
Bound bodies are trapped and can’t move to be free.<br />
Sleepless nights blend with days filled with pain,<br />
True bodies are fading, ensnared by the chain.<br /><br />

Reality mingles with illusion's embrace,<br />
Family and friends have lost all their grace.<br />
Miracles won’t change what’s already infected,<br />
To have a stranger feels all too accepted.</em>		  </p>
          </div>

		  <h3> Light </h3>
		  <p>
		  <em>I saw a bright light hidden deep in the wood,<br />
I’ll meet you there in the dream where I stood.<br />
I want to end this journey and rescue your heart,<br />
And rest in peace, as you promised from the start.<br /><br />

I no longer wish to stay where darkness prevails,<br />
I just want to understand where all of time trails.<br />
Beneath the rain clouds, I’ll find my way home,<br />
But sadly, I know that you won’t be there to roam.<br /><br />

Your voice will echo like a strong ocean wave,<br />
In my eyes, I’ll see storms of the memories I save.<br />
Birds will entice me to fly away with you,<br />
Yet my thoughts will hold back, unsure of what’s true.<br /><br />

We’ll meet in winter when the lilies will fade,<br />
I’ll run to you, like a soldier betrayed.<br />
With pain, I’ll find healing, though scars will still show,<br />
For the hurt I have carried has long since grown.<br /></em>

		  <h3> Mother </h3>
          <p>
      <em>I’ll bring you a bouquet of wildflowers fair,<br />
      Embracing you tightly, my heart feels the wear.<br />
      I’ll tell you a dream of a childhood so bright,<br />
      And only you’ll remind me what mothering's light.</em><br /><br />

      <em>You’ll heal all the scars that life’s journey has left,<br />
      You’ll understand how without you, I’m bereft.<br />
      I just want to see you, to hold you so near,<br />
      Beneath the starry sky, share tales without fear.</em><br /><br />

      <em>I’ll cradle your silver hair close to my chest,<br />
      I’ll gather your tears that from cheeks have expressed.<br />
      Together we’ll laugh at life’s trials and pains,<br />
      While my heart will recall all the joy that remains.</em>
    </p>
          </div>

		  <h3>Stronghold</h3>
<p>
 <em> They fiercely gather the courage to oppose<br />
  Urging lies, stirring our holy homes -<br />
  Without them, our gathered calling fades,<br />
  For a battle without arms is life without aims.<br /><br />

  I call upon the nation, I call upon you!<br />
  Has the painful end now come to be?<br />
  To triumph over evil is my honest duty;<br />
  To surrender to rejection, I shall say ‘no’ truly.<br /><br />

  Desire and fear, the start of my stronghold.<br />
  Let suffering cause suffering to your body, be bold!<br />
  I, as a falcon, will soar in the sky’s embrace;<br />
  I will find you, and together, we will glow at dusk’s grace.<br /><br />

  The foundations of my land trampled red.<br />
  In the distance, women’s cries plead,<br />
  Children’s tiny footsteps are lost in the unknown.<br />
  It is your fault for letting death’s seed be sown.<br /><br />

  Clasping hands, we won’t retreat to the sea,<br />
  We will shout victory and march into the battle.<br />
  Our blood, the imprints leading to the future’s door;<br />
  Perhaps tomorrow, we will rise to the final response.</em>
