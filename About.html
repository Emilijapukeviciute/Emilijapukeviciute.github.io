        My name is Emilija Pukevičiūtė, and I was born in Klaipėda, Lithuania. Since I was a little girl, 
        I believed that in the future, I would be working in a field that combines creativity and communication.<br>
        In a way, I was not wrong, as I am currently studying contemporary communications at LCC International University 
        and learning about various things, from writing articles to meeting diverse people from all around the world.<br>
        This place taught me how to be more open-minded and express myself and my work, and for that, I am very grateful.
    </p>

    <p>
        Writing is one of the coping mechanisms that helps me resolve my problems, control my emotions, 
        and feel free when expressing myself.<br>
        When I was 18 years old, I started to write poems, but it seemed strange that I had ideas only 
        when I was sad or overwhelmed.<br>
        Most of my poems consist of themes such as war, loneliness, freedom, fakeness, and many more.<br>
        After writing poems for one year, I realized that I feel more relaxed. I learned how to control my emotions 
        because every time I feel like I am about to "explode," I take a pen and write what comes to mind.<br>
        I strongly encourage people to take a pen and write their thoughts and feelings. This method is like therapy, 
        only it is free, and it allows you to express what is in your heart.
