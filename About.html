              I am Emilija Pukevičiūtė and I am currently studying contemporary communications at LCC International University. Since I was a teenager I had a tendency to journal my thoughts when I felt overwhelmed. When I was 18 years old I discovered that I love rhyming words and putting them into columns and in 2022 I wrote my first poem about Ukraine war called February 24th.The reason I wrote this poem was because I felt missheard and was dealing with bunch of emotions that I could.t handle anymore. Writing helps me to be calm and feel safe even in toughest periods. That is why I encourage a lot of poeple to speak through written words and feel free.
